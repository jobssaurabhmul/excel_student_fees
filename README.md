# excel_student_fees

**Problem Statement:**

In this project I assume the role of an Institute that provides classes to students on various subjects.
I need to understand my data better. I will be using Pivot Tables and Charts to get a good understanding of the data.

**Notes:**

I have created data using the help of mockaroo.com.

**Data:**

The data is across two tables (excel workbook sheets).
1. Data containing details of the courses that I offer.
2. Data containing details of students, their payments so far.

**Objective:**

Create a Dashboard to track revenue.



**Procedure:**

1. First I "Joined" the two tables using Vlookup. This new table is in the sheet "Join"
2. Next I created pivot tables to track different data.
3. Charts were inserted as needed.
4. Finally a Dashboard was created. Slicers are added to the dashboard for interactivity.
